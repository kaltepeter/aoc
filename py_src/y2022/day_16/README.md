# Day 16

## Data

PipeMap -> graph of valves and tunnels with pressure as the weight

## Calc

## Function/Process

1. Process input into graph with weights
   1. If the flow rate is 0, don't use weights
   1. If tunnel can't be reached from a path that is a high number
1. Floyd-Warshall Algorithm to calculate all distances of shortest paths
1.
