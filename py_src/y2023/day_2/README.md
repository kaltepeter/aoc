# Day 2

## Approach

- Get a list of games and the cubes with rounds with RGB tuples
- Filter any rounds that exceed the max cubes
- add the ids

```python
{
  1: [(4, 0, 3), (1, 2, 6), (0, 2, 0)],
  2: [(0, 2, 1), (1, 3, 4), (0, 1, 1)],
  3: [(20, 8, 6), (4, 13, 5), (1, 5, 0)],
  4: [(3, 1, 6), (6, 3, 0), (14, 3, 15)],
  5: [(6, 3, 1), (1, 2, 2)],
}
```
