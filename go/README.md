AOC in Go

## Creating a new Day

Templates directory has a `go-day-template` dir. Copy that and modify.

- The test is intentionally broken.
- The Inputs parsing is bare minimum. Modify for complex examples.

```bash
cd go
AOC_GO_DAY=17
mkdir ./2021/day_${AOC_GO_DAY}
cp ../templates/go-day-template/* ./2021/day_${AOC_GO_DAY}
```
